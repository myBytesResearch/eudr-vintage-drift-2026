"""Mask A — historical forest loss after the EUDR cut-off date.

Mask A in this pipeline implicitly combines TWO Hansen bands:

  1. ``treecover2000`` — only pixels that were forest (>= 30 % cover) at the
     year-2000 baseline. This excludes savanna, cropland, water and built-up
     pixels from the loss accounting.
  2. ``lossyear`` — restrict to pixels whose loss event occurred after the
     EUDR cut-off (Hansen encodes 2021 as the integer 21).

The combined condition is::

    Mask_A(x) = (treecover2000(x) >= 30 %)  AND  (lossyear(x) >= 21)

This matches the upstream internal myBytes pipeline implementation in
``src/data/forest_loss/cocoa_conversion.py`` (function ``conversion_layers``).

The function in this module is data-source agnostic: it takes pre-loaded
NumPy arrays and returns a boolean mask. Loading the rasters from Hansen
via Google Earth Engine, Microsoft Planetary Computer or local TIFFs is
the caller's responsibility — see ``notebooks/02_live_gee_pipeline.ipynb``
for an example.
